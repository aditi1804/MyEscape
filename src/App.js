Her first song on Soundcloud is 'Why do we go?' recorded barely on earphones and she produced the music on bandlab. After uploading a couple of songs, she started her journey on Youtube, uploading original songs and cover songs. Her biggest inspiration is Taylor Swift.

               Schatzi is a song written sung and composed by Aditi Morya.  Hey, I wrote Schatzi yesterday and I am so excited to share the song, I was wondering about the drift in our feelings, thought process as time passes and we grow older, the kind of positivity we have in our life when we are young - full of hopes and dreams thinking that we won't leave even a single stone unturned and then the gradual change which made me imagine how would life be in 40s and 60s, so I penned down this song.
Give it a listen and comment below what you feel about this song.
Earphones recommended :)

Lyrics -
Schatzi - Aditi Morya

Dreaming dreams was my happy thing
Till you arrived and changed every bit
Healing cracks, time is mystical
Could look at you, 24*7

And we are crazy, lazy and having fun
Ceasing moments, no worries, we're twenty one
Dream of landing big, making every move
Not running out of time, every failure's our muse

Stay for the better
Say you'd be here forever
Would you stay here forever, Schatzi
Stay for the better
Say you'd be here forever
Would you stay here forever, Schatzi

Time's hard or it's so relative
The shit we hated, now we are living it
Head loaded with responsibilities
(Set me free)
Monthly bills and sleeping pills

Will we be crazy, lazy, having fun?
Will be 60s, bothering everyone
With stick and spects, wrinkling our lives
On the couch,  album 
Throwback to the past times

Stay for the better
Say you'd be here forever
Would you stay here forever, Schatzi
Stay for the better
Say you'd be here forever
Would you stay here forever, Schatzi

Baarishon mein jhoomte,
Phirakte kadam yaad hain?
Yaadon mein jab bhi dhoondoon main
Tu hi bs tu hi paas hai

Stay for the better
Say you'd be here forever
Would you stay here forever, Schatzi

Lyrics -

Verse 

Dear Mr Secret
How well your eyes danced.
With every single move,
Took my breath away.
With grace
Dancing to your heartbeat,
The shyest version of me.


I know it is said,
Love's a ruthless game
But when I look at you
It all fades away,
I have no other option
This love is a distortion.

Chorus

Ooooo
In a small rented house,
Water dropping out from the ceiling.
We are still dancing around,
Tapping our feet like it's raining
You have got a hundred ways to calm me down.
I have got a thousand reasons to stay with you 
For the rest of my life

Verse

Dear Mr. Secret
You said you are not afraid
When I told 
"I am too good at ruining the game"
You packed up all my fears,
Said I will never let them creep in.


So many girls out there,
That you could go for.
When I think of it,
I fear of losing you
You said, "Hey, I have no other option
My heart ain't at the auction".

Chorus 

Oooooo
In a small rented house,
Water dropping out from the ceiling.
We are still dancing around,
Tapping our feet like it's raining.
You have got a hundred ways to calm me down,
I have got a thousand reasons to stay with you
For the rest of my life.

Outro

So the morning light woke me up again,
Laying by my side was my guitar and a pen.

I was writing a song for you
Then I slept and dreamt
That's what I always do
